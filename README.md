# BlissLauncher - No Default Widgets Fork

[BlissLauncher](https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/BlissLauncher) comes with widgets that are pre-installed and the user is unable to remove them (as they are hard-coded).  

This fork removes the Search & Suggested Apps widgets.

All credits go to [ram-on](https://github.com/ram-on), I merely merged their (archived) fork into the latest master from the GitLab.
